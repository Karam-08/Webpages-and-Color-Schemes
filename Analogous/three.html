<!-- DESCRIPTION: Analogous website
The Red shows that the farm is passionate about their turkeys
The Yellow represents sunshine, like on a nice fall day
Orange represents warmth and youth, like how you would feel when eating one of their chickens

Red, Yellow, and Orange are also commonly associated with Fall, and Thanksgiving happens on fall. (Duh!) -->

                We sell many Turkeys that are frozen and on the go! Our Turkeys come Pre-Seasoned, and you can include other sides like Mashed Potatoes for some extra cash.
                The Turkeys are tended with love and care until they are ripe enough for slaughter. Then, we season the meat with our famous Lemon Pepper or Cajun seasoning. Really, it's all up to you.
                You can even get one unseasoned!
